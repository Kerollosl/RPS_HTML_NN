Steps:
	1. Run the "C1_W4_Lab1_retrain" HTML file with an Internet server.
	2. Physically make "Rock" figures with your hand and click the "Rock" button to collect train data
	   images labeled "Rock". Repeat the same for Paper and Scissors. There is no requirement for the number of samples for each 
	   figure label, however the more samples generated, the better predictions will be. 
	3. Once a suitable number of train data has been dynamically generated, press the "Train Network" Button to train a neural network 
	   with the data. 
	4. Select "Start Predicting" to generate predictions for any following rock, paper, or scissors figure made in the live webcam.
